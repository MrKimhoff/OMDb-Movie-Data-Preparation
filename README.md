# OMDb Movie Data Preparation Project

This project uses the Python programming language to clean and prepare movie data retrieved from an [API OMDb](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to prepare a cleaned dataset so that it could be used to train a machine learning model.

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualizaiton
* Summary Statistics

### Technologies Used
* Python (BeautifulSoup, Pandas, NumPy, etc)
* SQL
* Jupyter

## Project Description
The first step of this project involved data collection. Data was collected using flat files .csvs, API calls, and databases. After the data was collected, the data was cleaned using the Python programming language. Once the data was cleaned, some data visulizations were created to get a peek at the underlying data trends.
